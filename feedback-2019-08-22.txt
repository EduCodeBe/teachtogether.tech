- The last paragraph of the dedication has changed (because MSF wouldn't take
  our money) and should read:

        All royalties from the sale of this book are being donated to
                            the Carpentries,
                  a volunteer organization that teaches
               foundational coding and data science skills
                      to researchers worldwide.

- pg 2: Gene uses gender-neutral pronouns (a singular "they"). Please do *NOT*
  change this.

- pg 19: The diagrams are not hand-drawn - I use a vector drawing tool called
  draw.io to create them, then apply a roughening style so that people will be
  more willing to give honest or critical feedback on them.  (This is sometimes
  called "Johnson's Rule", though I have not been able to track down a reliable
  citation for it.)

- pg 22: "...that _fill_ fit in..." should be "...that _will_ fit in..."

- pg 29: I'm not accustomed to including page numbers for quotes from papers,
  only from books (because page numbers for papers will change in reprints and
  collections). One of your reviewers makes this point further down on pg 38.

- pg 36 (diagram): There isn't an arrowhead missing, but I agree it's confusing.
  Linguistic and visual combine in the label "integrated" that feeds into
  "short-term memory". I tried laying out the diagram with two arrows, both
  labeled "integrated", but that seemed more crowded and confusing. If I change
  the label to "are integrated", will that be clearer?

- pg 42: I use "data" for the singular rather than "datum", so would prefer to
  leave this as "data...is". (My father and I never agreed on this...)

- pg 43: I use "Section" when referring to a section of an appendix (as here),
  and only use the words "Chapter" and "Appendix" when referring to the entire
  unit - this seems more consistent with using "Section" instead of "Chapter"
  when referring to a section in the main text.

- pg 44: If this is being changed to the word "two", I feel the phrase should be
  "two to four" because "two--four" looks odd.  Also, on pg 46 you have 5--10,
  so 2--4 seems more consistent here.

- pg 45: I agree that this is consistent, but I'm used to seeing "top 10" lists
  rather than "top ten" lists.

- pg 46: I'm puzzled at this point: is the rule to use words for single digits
  and numbers when there are multiple digits? And is "three--four" common usage?
  I haven't seen it.

- pg 49: I believe "what they are" is grammatically correct.

- pg 62: Again, "two--three" looks very strange to me.

- pg 64: The diagram is a full-resolution screenshot - I don't know how to
  create a higher-quality image. If you can send me instructions on how to
  create something better, I'd be happy to try.

- pg 68: This is a screen capture from a PDF; I attempted to contact the authors
  to get a better quality image but received no reply. If there's a way to
  extract the image directly from the source PDF, I'd be grateful for
  instructions.

- pg 73: Meant to be "typing it in".

- pg 74: As above, I use "data" as both singular and plural.

- pg 75: In this case, I believe it's clearer if the full stop comes outside the
  inner-quoted word 'right' but inside the double quotes.

- pg 76: I'm used to seeing the names of centuries title-cased as in "19th
  Century" rather than "19th century" - have you lower-cased because this is an
  adjective rather than a proper noun?

- pg 81: As above, I believe it's more consistent to use "Section" to refer to
  sections of both appendices and chapters (I wouldn't say "Chapter 1.3").

- pg 83: As above, "two--three" looks strange to me.

- pg 84: No - "live codes" is a verb (albeit a clumsy one). If "does" is
  inserted here, "live codes" should be changed to "live coding".

- pg 88: As above, "two--four" looks strange to me.

- pg 91: As above, I think "Section F.5" is more consistent with "Chapter 3.5"
  than "Appendix F.5" would be.

- pg 92: I really don't understand the rule being used to decide what is digits
  and what is words...

- pg 98: As above re Appendix F.3.

- pg 106: Insert "and" after "nature posers" to be consistent with the preceding
  parenthesized example.

- pg 108: I don't think the inserted "they" is needed in the first paragraph -
  the subject is the preceding "they", which is quite close.

- pg 117: As above, "four--six" looks very strange to me.

- pg 119: I'm unable to see whether the suggested insertion after "athletics" is
  a comma or an apostrophe, but I don't think it's required in either case.

- pg 120: I do not understand why "30" becomes "thirty" but "76" is left alone.

- pg 130: As above, I don't understand the rule being used to choose prose
  versus digits (100 versus "a hundred").

- pg 149: I think this should be "it", since it refers back to either "pasture"
  or "set".

- pg 158: I believe the comma should go outside the quotes, since this is
  (purportedly) the title of a book. Or would it be better to italicize the
  "title"?

- pg 161: Re "17" vs "seventeen", I do not understand the rule for using digits
  versus using prose.

- pg 168: I believe the comma should go outside the quotes since this is the
  title of an essay.

- pg 168: Please insert a blank line before "Thank you for reading" to make the
  paragraph separation clearer.

- pg 169 and following: The bibliography is formatted using the Chicago style file,
  which didn't put a full stop inside the quoted title of papers. I'm happy with the
  change if you want to make it, and would be even happier if someone could send me
  an updated '.cls' file to get LaTeX to do this - I tried and failed.

- pg 179 (in Douce et al reference): I don't know either - please remove. (I
  think it was an editing glitch in the .bib file.)

- pg 196: I agree, but I don't know how to control hyphenation in BibTeX entries.
  Guidance would be welcome.

- pg 220 (after definition of "Connectivism"): Add full stop after "internet".

- pg 221 (definition of "Far transfer"): Unfortunately the phrase "transfer of
  learning" has to be bold, since it's a cross-reference. Please insert the word
  "The" before it and lower-case the 't' in "transfer" to make this clearer.

- pg 222: remove comma after "don't" in definition of "free-range learners".

- pg 224 (definition of "Near transfer"): As above, "transfer of learning" has
  to be in bold because it's a cross reference. I suggest inserting the word
  "The" before "transfer of learning" to make the separation clear.

- pg 224 (definition of Parsons Problem): Citation should be to [Pars2006].

- pg 225 (definition of productive failure): This reads more clearly if we
  change it to "the knowledge they have and must go out".

- pg 226: use "See" instead of "see" in definition of "working memory" to be
  consistent with usage higher up.

- pg 228: "an hour of training an hour" should be "an hour of training on how".
